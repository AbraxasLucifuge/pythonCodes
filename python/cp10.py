#Create a package. It should contain a module that takes a value ‘a’ and
#performs ‘a + a’. The package should also contain a subpackage. The
#subpackage should contain two modules. The first module takes a value
#‘b’ and performs the operation ‘b * b’. The second module should
#relatively import the contents of the first module and also the contents
#of the module in the main package. In addition it should perform the
#operation ‘c * c * c’. Here, a, b and c are integer variables.
